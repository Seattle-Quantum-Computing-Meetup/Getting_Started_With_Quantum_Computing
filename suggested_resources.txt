For books, there are a lot of great ones out there.  
Two of those which are free in their digital versions are - one by Thomas Wong and another by Olivier Ezratty.  
The standard great book is by Nielsen and Chuang.  
I also like the book for programmers by Robert Hundt.  
Two nice books for beginners is one by Jack Hidary and a "Dummies" book by whurley et al.  
Robert Sutor's books published by Packt are also good, like I said, there are lots of good ones out there, 
including the one for computer scientists by Yanofsky and Mannucci and the O'Reilly book by Johnston, Harrigan et al.  

For classes, there are some for "everyone" and some for programmers by UChicago on edX, 
MIT xPro offers one for a much larger fee, and 
IBM offers a Summer School, and you can find their past videos on YouTube.  

You can search YouTube and Medium, and find LOTS of material on quantum computing.  Xanadu has some short educational videos there.  

Quantum Twitter and LI also have a lot of interesting, informative posts.  

You can check out conferences such as: IEEE Quantum Week, Q2B, and QIP (not exactly for beginners).
